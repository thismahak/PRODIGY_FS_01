# PRODIGY_WD_02 - User Authentication System with JWT

Welcome to the **PRODIGY_WD_02** repository. This repository contains the code for Task 2 of my Web Development Internship, where I implemented a **User Authentication System** using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

## Task Description

In this task, I built a **User Authentication System** that includes **Registration**, **Login**, and **Protected Routes**. The users can register, log in, and access protected routes based on their roles (user or admin).

### Features Implemented:
- **User Registration**: Users can register with a unique email, username, and password.
- **Login**: Users can log in with their username and password.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication using **JWT tokens**.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different routes are accessible based on the user's role (e.g., admin, user).
- **Protected Routes**: Access restricted to certain routes only if the user has a valid JWT token.

## Technologies Used:
- **Node.js**: For creating the backend server.
- **Express**: For building the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication.
- **bcryptjs**: For password hashing.
